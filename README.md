## Description

  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, I built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer and MySQL.

  ```
  As a business owner
  I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
  So that I can organize and plan my business
  ```
